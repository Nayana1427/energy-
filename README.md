##**Electric Vehicle Charging Load Forecasting Using ML**

This project predicts future EV (Electric Vehicle) charging energy demand using machine learning.
It helps to estimate how much electricity EV chargers will use in the next few hours or days.

***This is useful for:***

1.Power grid management

2.Charging station planning

3.Reducing overload and blackouts

4.Energy cost optimization

The project uses a cleaned dataset, trains a machine learning model, and forecasts future energy demand.

***This project includes:***

1.Cleaned dataset 

2. Preprocessing script

3.Model training script

4. Scaling tool (scaler.pkl)

5.Forecasting script

6.Visualization script

7.Optional Streamlit App

***Requirements***

Install all needed libraries using:

pip install -r requirements.txt


The main libraries used are:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

xgboost

matplotlib

joblib

***How to Run the Project***

1️⃣ Place your dataset

2️⃣ Train the Model

3️⃣ Forecast the Next 24 Hours

4️⃣ Visualize the Results

***Goal of This Project***

The aim is to build a complete end-to-end EV charging forecasting system, including:

data preprocessing

feature engineering

machine learning

forecasting

visualization
